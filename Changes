Revision history for ngs.plot.

1.64  Mar 7, 2013
    - Significant improvement to coverage calculation. The program now calculate
      coverage based on needs by extracting bam files on the go. This has 
      significantly reduced memory requirement.
    - cov.calc.r has been removed from the package. There is no need to pre-
      calculate coverage any more.
    - replot.r now supports heatmap and a few other options to tune figures.
    - The result files are now wrapped as a zip file for cleaness.

1.34  Feb 23, 2013
    - A lot of code re-writing to optimize performance and to modularize the 
      project.
    - More usage of parallel processing.
    - Added new heatmap function.
    - Implemented 6 algorithms to order genes in heatmaps.
    - Added column subset function in replot.r.
    - Used robust statistics as default for avg. profile plot.
    - Reconstruction of the gene database and speedup annotation loading by ~6 
      folds.

1.05  Dec 3, 2012
    - Fix bugs in calculating physical coverage 
    - Fix bugs in the scripts that are used to extract exons from Cufflinks.

1.04  Nov 12, 2012 
    - Automatic turning off SEM when there is only single gene given in gene 
      list.
    - Misc. re-organization of ngs.plot.r code.
    - Some re-organization of distribution folder.
    - Added example gene list; example data for user to run through.
    - Added script "alt_reg_cufflinks" which extracts all alternative regions in
      one command.
